This historic agreement will see India progressively lower import taxes, with the majority of goods exchanged becoming fully tariff-free within the next ten years!

Did you know? This deal is a significant step towards strengthening economic ties between the two countries and increasing their global influence. It's all about staying competitive in today's fast-paced world!
