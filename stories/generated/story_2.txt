Here's a YouTube Shorts script about Trump's U.S. attorney nomination of Ed Martin facing Senate hurdles:

"Did you know? Ed Martin, nominated to be the US Attorney in Washington, DC, could face a tough time getting approved by the Senate due to his advocacy for Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. This nomination is raising eyebrows and creating tension because of Martin's defense of those involved in the riots.

It's crucial that our justice system remains impartial and unbiased.
