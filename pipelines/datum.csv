A gun massacre of tourists on April 22 pushed India and Pakistan a step closer to war, their most serious confrontation in decades.","Did you know that tensions between nuclear-armed countries India and Pakistan escalated recently? Let's take a look at the timeline of events that led to de-escalation.
On April 22, a gun massacre of tourists occurred at a well-known religious site in Indian-administered Kashmir, causing widespread outrage. Pakistan responded by expelling India's High Commissioner and cutting off rail and bus links.
India retaliated with heavy shelling across the border, and both countries amassed troops along their disputed border known as the Line of Control in Kashmir. The world held its breath, fearing a potential nuclear conflict.
But just a week later, diplomatic talks were held between the two nations, leading to a ceasefire agreement. Pakistan returned the Indian High Commissioner, and both countries agreed to maintain peace on their shared border.

2,"Why Trump isn’t leading an emergency effort to ease the India-Pakistan crisis

The violent crisis between India and Pakistan is exactly the kind of international emergency that would once have prompted a full-on US diplomatic drive to cool tempers and head off a wider war.","Did you know? The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated tensions in South Asia, causing global concern. However, unlike previous crises, President Trump isn't leading an emergency effort to ease the tension. Here's what it means:
The change in approach is a reflection of the evolving US foreign policy under the Trump administration. The U.S., historically, has often played the role of peace broker in South Asia, especially during India-Pakistan disputes. But today, Washington seems to be taking a step back, allowing regional powers to manage their conflicts without direct U.S. involvement.
So why does this matter? The decreased US involvement could shift the balance of power in the region and reshape global alliances. It also raises questions about the future role of the United States in international crisis management.
