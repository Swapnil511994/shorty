4,"Who is in charge in Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif or army chief Asim Munir?

Though India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday, the Pakistan Army, headed by General Asim Munir, quickly violated the agreement. Experts say the conflict provides a chance for Munir to take complete control of Pakistan if he hasn’t already, and that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif likely has little say when it comes to the policy with India","Did you know? The leadership structure in Pakistan is a complex balance between civilian and military powers. So, who's in charge - Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif or army chief Asim Munir?
