00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,275
Did you know that the Triple Crown is one of the most prestigious achievements in horse racing?

2
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:12,303
The Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes are the three races that make up this historic event.

3
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:15,545
A horse must win all three to claim the coveted title.

4
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:23,893
This year, Sovereignty, the victor of the Kentucky Derby, has decided not to run in the Preakness Stakes on May 17.

5
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:29,920
This means the chance for a Triple Crown winner in 2023 is now non-existent.

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,283
But what does this mean for horse racing fans?

7
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:41,380
The absence of sovereignty from the Preakness stakes opens the door for other contenders to shine and potentially win this year’s second jewel of the Triple Crown.

00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:49,814
It also shows how unpredictable and exciting horse racing can be, making each race a thrilling event to watch.

00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,765
