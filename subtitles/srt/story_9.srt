00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:06,485
The Trump administration is planning to send migrants to Libya on a military flight.

3
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:15,624
This news has sparked controversy due to the reported horrific and deplorable conditions in Libya’s network of migrant detention centers.

00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:25,004
The move is being criticized for potentially subjecting vulnerable migrants to dangerous situations and human rights abuses.

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:33,884
It’s important to remember that Libya is currently embroiled in conflict and has a poor track record when it comes to treating migrants humanely.

But why does this matter?
