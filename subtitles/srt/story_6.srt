Did you know that in baseball, a walk-off is when a team wins the game during their final at bat?

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,642

Let me explain.

00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:22,242
With two outs and down to their last strike, the Royals managed to score a run on a wild pitch.

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,004
That’s not all.

7
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:28,175
With bases loaded, the White Sox catcher made an unusual error, allowing another run to score.

8
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:30,841
And just like that, the game was over.

00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:34,771
The hilarious blunder by the White Sox has got everyone talking.

10
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,060
It’s not every day you see a team give away a game so spectacularly.
