00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,471
Did you know?

00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,815
The US and Houthi forces in Yemen have agreed to a temporary ceasefire.

3
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,118
But, here’s the catch.

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:12,384
The Houthis say they’ll evaluate the proposal before making a final decision.

5
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:18,830
President Trump announced this move after the Houthis promised to halt their attacks on American ships.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:26,778
This is significant because it could lead to peace talks between the Yemeni government and the Houthis, potentially ending years of conflict in the war-torn nation.

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,801
So, what does this mean?

8
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:35,304
It’s a step towards de-escalation, but we’ll have to wait and see if both parties hold their end of the deal.
