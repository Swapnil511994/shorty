Narration.

00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:06,461
Hello.

00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:15,497
Today we dive into the political landscape of Israel, focusing on its long-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,806
Despite facing corruption charges, his recent moves could reshape the Middle East.

00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:27,696
Netanyahu has formed a unity government with his rival, Benny Gantz, ending over a year of political deadlock.

00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:34,868
This alliance, while temporary, aims to manage Israel's challenges amidst regional tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:37,011
But wait, there's more!

00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:45,343
Netanyahu's cabinet includes several hardliners who might take Israel in new directions, such as annexing West Bank territories.

00:00:45,323 --> 00:01:02,909
This move could change the balance of power in the Middle East and impact peace negotiations with Palestine.
